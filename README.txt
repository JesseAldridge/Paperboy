Paperboy is a simple web-app used to post articles to a website and maintain a
mailing list.

Note:  This tool is still very half-baked and hasn't yet been used by anyone
but myself.  It probably won't work for you.

Setup
-------

Download the Paperboy source code.

Install the required libs with pip or whatever:

    pip install -U -r requirements.pip

Set your login info and stuff in settings.py.

Run wsgi.py.

Now go to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser and the app should be up
and running.
